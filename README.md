# Zyntax: Natural Language Terminal Interface

**Zyntax** is an intelligent terminal interface that understands natural language commands. Skip memorizing complex command syntax across different operating systems - just tell Zyntax what you want to do in plain English or Hinglish.

Zyntax bridges the gap between human language and command-line interfaces, making terminal operations accessible to everyone while maintaining the power and efficiency developers love.

üî• **Cross-platform**: Works consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows  
üß† **Smart parsing**: Advanced NLP with spaCy for accurate intent recognition in English and Hinglish  
‚ö° **Fast**: Optimized for real-time command processing  
üõ† **Extensible**: Built with modularity and extensibility in mind
